# CS Python Lab 01 - Intro

## Example Submission with Automatic Answer Checking System

The automatic answer checking system verifies the results obtained from the programming task. The yellow blank spaces shown are the areas where the learner needs to write the program, either by completing parts of it or the entire program.

The incomplete Python program below aims to print the outputs "Hello." and "Goodbye." on the screen.

## Follow these steps:

Try filling in the text "good" (including the double quotes) in the blank space, then click the Submit button at the bottom to submit your answer.

Observe the small icon next to the Task name in the top left corner of the page.

The icon  means that the submitted answer is being processed.

After a moment, the icon may change to  indicating that the submitted answer is incorrect.

Alternatively, the icon may change to  indicating that the submitted answer is correct.

If you follow step 1, the icon should indicate that the answer is incorrect.

Next, fill in the text in the same yellow blank space with "Goodbye." (including the double quotes), and then click the Submit button again. This time, the result should indicate that the answer is correct.

## Details of the Results
Some submissions may have more than one test case. Observe the top line next to the Task name for details.


Characters within brackets [] indicate whether the submitted answer passed or failed each test case. Possible characters are:

P = Pass: The program submitted produces the expected result for the test case.

"-" = Fail: The program submitted does not produce the expected result for the test case.

S = Incorrect Spacing: The result is correct but has spacing issues (e.g., the expected result is "Hi there" but the program outputs "Hithere" or "Hi there").

C = Incorrect Case: The result is correct but has incorrect casing (e.g., the expected result is "Hello" but the program outputs "hello").
